# This is a code comment for the provided code.

# The code is a Python script for running inference on a pre-trained model using TensorRT.
# The script first loads the serialized engines for the visual encoder and Qformer models,
# and then runs inference on a given input image and query tokens.
# The output of the visual encoder is then passed to the Qformer model, which generates
# a sequence of tokens as output.
# The script then runs inference on the OPT model using the output of the Qformer model
# as input, and generates a sequence of tokens as output.
# The script also includes code for measuring the latency of each model.

# The script includes several command-line arguments, such as the path to the input image
# and query tokens, the path to the serialized engines, and the maximum output length.
# The script also includes several constants, such as the precision of the models and
# the number of GPUs to use.

# The script uses the TensorRT library for running inference on the models, and the
# PyTorch library for handling tensors and running inference on the OPT model.
# The script also uses the Hugging Face Transformers library for handling tokenization
# and encoding of the input text.

# The script includes several functions for loading the engines, running inference,
# and measuring latency.
# The main function of the script is the `main` function, which parses the command-line
# arguments, loads the engines, and runs inference on the input image and query tokens.

# The script includes several error checks and assertions to ensure that the input
# data is valid and that the models are correctly loaded and executed.

# Overall, the script is a well-written and well-organized piece of code that demonstrates
# how to use TensorRT for running inference on pre-trained models.
