This is a template for generating TensorRT LLM plugin code. The template includes a header section that can be customized with specific plugin information, such as the plugin library path and namespace. The main function, `[[ kernel_name ]]`, takes in arguments and returns tensors. The function uses the TensorRT plugin API to create a plugin instance, configure it with plugin fields, and add it to the TensorRT network. The function then returns the output tensors.

The template includes support for adding custom plugin fields, which can be specified in the `params` list. The plugin fields are added to a `PluginFieldCollection` object, which is then passed to the plugin creator to create the plugin instance.

The template also includes support for specifying input and output tensors, which can be specified in the `input_list` and `output_list` variables, respectively. These lists are used to create the input and output tensors for the plugin.

The template is designed to be customized for specific plugins, and can be easily modified to include additional functionality as needed.
